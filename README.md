Description of my projects and links to the relevant repositories.

| Project | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Understanding Clouds from Satellite Images](https://github.com/datascienceslugs/dss-cloudclassification) | (WIP) A Kaggle competition we used a U-net architecture to perform image segmentation, using TensorFlow and pandas.|
| [LANL Earthquake Prediction](https://github.com/datascienceslugs/dss-earthquakes) | My first Kaggle competition, in which I use stacked models (random forests, support vector regression and k-nearest neighbors) to predict earthquakes, finishing in the top ~5%. Implemented mostly in scikit-learn |
| [Who is Satoshi?](https://github.com/Jswig/Computational-Futurology/blob/master/Who_Is_Satoshi/CRWN88_HW3.pdf) | Open-ended class project where I use text mining in R to determine whether cryptographer Nick Szabo might have written under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto |
| [Access to Birth Control in the U.S.](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DtbDNyi160zuXgVyBocp7d1TX9Zl3crS) | Open-ended final group project in which we use regression to predict access to birth control on a state basis. 
| [Kanada MNIST](https://github.com/datascienceslugs/dss-kannada/blob/master/notebooks/0.1-apoirel-nntest.ipynb) | Variant of the MNIST Competition on Kaggle I used to practice neural networks.
| [Data Science Workshops](https://github.com/datascienceslugs/workshops) | Deliverables for data science worshops I led in club meetings | 
| [Data Science AZ](https://github.com/Jswig/DataScienceAZ/blob/master/SimpleLinearRegression/salary_slr.md) | Material from the Data  science AZ course re-implemented in R, for teaching use in club meetings|
| [Numerical Analysis](https://github.com/Jswig/numerical-diffeqs/blob/master/Solutions.ipynb)| Implementation in Python of numerical methods for solving first-order differential equations and some optimization problems|
