Description of my projects and links to the relevant repositories.

| Project | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [LANL Earthquake Prediction](https://github.com/datascienceslugs/dss-earthquakes) | My first Kaggle competition, in which I use stacked models (random forests, support vector regression and k-nearest neighbors) to predict earthquakes, finishing in the top 37% |
| [Who is Satoshi?](https://github.com/Jswig/Computational-Futurology/blob/master/Who_Is_Satoshi/CRWN88_HW3.pdf) | Open-ended class project where I use text mining in R to determine whether cryptographer Nick Szabo might have written under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto |
| [Access to Birth Control in the U.S.](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DtbDNyi160zuXgVyBocp7d1TX9Zl3crS) | Open-ended final group project in which we use regression to predict access to birth control on a state basis. 
| [Predicting Salaries By Level of Experience](https://github.com/Jswig/DataScienceAZ/blob/master/SimpleLinearRegression/salary_slr.md) | Simple linear regression and graphing practice in R using a dataset from the Data Science A-Z course |
| [Numerical Analysis](https://github.com/Jswig/numerical-diffeqs/blob/master/Solutions.ipynb)| Implementation in Python of numerical methods for solving first-order differential equations and some optimization problems |
|[Red Hawks in California]() | |
