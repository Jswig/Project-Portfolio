Description of some of my projects and links to the relevant repositories.

| Project | Description | Technologies
| --- | --- | ---|
| [The Transparency Project](https://github.com/Jswig/dss-cruzhacks)| 1st place winner of the Cruzhacks 2020 hackathon at UC Santa Cruz, in which we scapped data on politcal ad spending and social media presence and presented it in a slick dashboard interface to give a transparent view of the power of money in politics. Live at [transparencyproject.tech](http://transparencyproject.tech/candidate_dashboard)| Javascript (Bootstrap), Python (flask, pandas, plotly, dash) |
| [DengAI: Predicting Disease Spread](https://github.com/datascienceslugs/dss-diseasespread)| (WIP) Predicting number of dengue occurences in two cities using gradient boosting and time-series based approaches| Python (pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn xgboost, hyperopt) |
| [Understanding Clouds from Satellite Images](https://github.com/datascienceslugs/dss-cloudclassification/tree/anders-testing) | (On Hold until I get access to a better GPU setup) A Kaggle competition we used a U-net architecture to perform image segmentation, using TensorFlow and pandas. Training was performed on a combination of campus HPC clusters and Google Cloud Compute instances| Python (TensorFlow, pandas), Google Cloud
| [LANL Earthquake Prediction](https://github.com/datascienceslugs/dss-earthquakes) | My first Kaggle competition, in which I use stacked models (random forests, support vector regression and k-nearest neighbors) to predict earthquakes, finishing in the top ~5%. Implemented mostly in scikit-learn |  Python (scikit-learn, pandas, numpy) |
| [Predicting Ratings from Reviews](https://github.com/Jswig/cse142-final-project)| Final project in which I implemented a LSTM model in TensorFlow  to predict star ratings from Yelp reviews| Python (TensorFlow, pandas) |
| [Detecting Phones](https://github.com/Jswig/bctakehome)| Computer vision project I used to learn OpenCV in which I implemented an algorithm that detects phones on floors| Python (OpenCV)
| [Who is Satoshi?](https://github.com/Jswig/Computational-Futurology/blob/master/Who_Is_Satoshi/CRWN88_HW3.pdf) | Open-ended class project where I use text mining in R to determine whether cryptographer Nick Szabo might have written under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto | R (tm), LaTeX 
| [Access to Birth Control in the U.S.](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DtbDNyi160zuXgVyBocp7d1TX9Zl3crS) | Open-ended final project and research paper in which we use regression to predict access to birth control on a state basis | R, Tableau |
| [Kanada MNIST](https://github.com/datascienceslugs/dss-kannada/blob/master/notebooks/0.1-apoirel-nntest.ipynb) | Variant of the MNIST Competition on Kaggle I used to learn about CNNS | Python (TensorFlow) |
| [Data Science Workshops](https://github.com/datascienceslugs/workshops) | Deliverables for data science worshops I led in club meetings |   pandas, numpy, matplotlib, plotly, scikit-learn|
| [Data Science AZ](https://github.com/Jswig/DataScienceAZ) | Material from the Data  science AZ course re-implemented in R, for teaching use in club meetings| R (rmarkdown, tidyverse, ggplot2) |
| [Numerical Analysis](https://github.com/Jswig/numerical-diffeqs/blob/master/Solutions.ipynb)| Implementation in Python of numerical methods for solving first-order differential equations and some optimization problems| Python |
| [Gradient Boosting](https://github.com/datascienceslugs/workshops/blob/master/workshops-w2020/boosting.pdf) | Files for the talk I delivered on Gradient Boosted Trees and XGBoost in Winter 2020 at Data Science @ SC | Python (xgboost, sklearn), LaTex |
| [Numerical Optimization](https://github.com/Jswig/DRP/blob/master/presentation/spring_2019_optimization.pdf) | Files for the talk I delivered on numerical optimization in Spring 2018 for the undergraduate Directed Reading Program | Python (numpy), LaTex |
